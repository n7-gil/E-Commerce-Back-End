# E-Commerce-Back-End

The purpose of this assignment was to create a fully functional database for a user in e-commerce. The database allows for the user to get, create, update, and delete the data from their database whenever needed using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes via Insomnia. The app create models and routes that allows the user to create categories for their products, add products to those categories, as well as adjust data of their products, including prices and quantity in stock. Overall it is allowing a user to update their own database to keep track of products.
